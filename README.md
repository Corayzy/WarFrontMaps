WarFront Maps Repository
==============

Official WarFront map repository. All maps that appear on the servers, you will find the configuration files here. Any modifications, deletions or additions must be done in the form of a considerable and valid ***pull request***.

#### Pull requests
If you are planning to make a deletion or modification, you will need to validate the priority and reason of the modification. If you are to pull a valid modification or deletion, it is most likely to be pushed instantly. Make sure to push ***one commit only*** for your pull request, as we will not accept requests with more than 1 commit except in certain situations. Make sure to include a **DIRECT** link to your map in the description when submitting a pull request.

#### Adding new maps
If your pull request is not a deletion or modification, you will need to make sure that the configuration is free of errors. If a configuration contains errors, mistakes or any malformations, the pull request will be *denied and closed*. If your map is accepted, the pull request will be marked as '*waiting*' and will be officially merged with the master branch when testing of the map is complete. If a map is tested and the configuration is found to be malformed, your pull request will be closed and you will have to re-submit the configuration again after correcting the error.
